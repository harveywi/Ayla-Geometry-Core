Ayla-Geometry-Core
==================

This project contains a (quick-and-dirty, barebones) implementation of
"Generating and Exploring a Collection of Topological Landscapes for
Visualization of Scalar-Valued Functions" by William Harvey and Yusu Wang,
EuroVis 2010.  It also contains an implementation of Hamish Carr's contour
tree algorithm, including some of the post-processing that didn't find its way
into mainstream publications (cf. the section in his PhD dissertation about
removing symbolic perturbation).

The quality of this code isn't quite stellar.  Some of it was written almost
seven years ago, and this is only a tiny, microscropic sliver of the volumes
of mostly throwaway code that I churned out while working on my PhD.  Be
warned...
